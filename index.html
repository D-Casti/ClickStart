        <h2>My Previous IT Experience</h2>
            <p>Previosuly I have been on a bootcamp course where I learnt Creative Computing. On this course I created an Audiobook App with a team that focused on adding audio notes to sections of the Audiobook. I have also taken part in a few online coding prgrammes such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://flatironschool.com" target="_blank">Flatiron</a>.</p>
        <h2>Why I am doing this course</h2>
            <p>I am doing this course as I would like to further develop my tech skills and find a pathway for a career in tech. I enjoy both aspects of coding and also design, so hopefully after completing this course I will be able to find something in those areas.</p>
        <h2>What I hope to gain from this course</h2>
            <p>I am hoping to gain more skills and also a stonger sense of which area of tech I would like to focus on. I also hope to get a job to begin a career in tech also.</p>
